# DRGL-X

{DRÃ†GONGLASS} blockchain data  

New users can now download this file for faster sync times or any issues with initial blockchain syncing. As we enforced a "mixin" limit (18)
for transactions in a later upgraded release, some users have a syncing issue with block 63312 - We found out this early network block contains a transaction with a mixin-count of 101....yes thats one hundred and one.. and certainly a private transaction ;)   Even still, CLI versions are able to sync beyond it without any problem. 
However some GUI wallet nodes hang at this block during its maiden chain syncing ..as we are finding out. If this such scenario is upon you- or if only for reasons of speed / convenience - use this download of the DRGL blockchain...
