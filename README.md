# DRGL-X
{DRGL} Chain data

{DRÃ†GONGLASS} blockchain data  

New users can now download this file for faster sync times or any issues with initial blockchain syncing. As we enforced a "mixin" limit (18)
for transactions in a later release, some OS have sync issue with block 63312 - as we found this early network block contains a transaction
with a mixin count of one hundred and one (101)..certainly private ;)   Even still, the CLI version is able to sync beyond it without any problem. 
However, the GUI embedded node will not..as we are finding out. If this rare scenario is upon you- or for reasons of speed- wish to use a download of the DRGL blockchain...
