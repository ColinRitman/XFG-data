{DRGL} Chain data

{DRÃ†GONGLASS} blockchain data  

New users can download this file for faster sync times or any issues with initial blockchain syncing. As we enforced a "mixin" limit
for transactions in a later release, some OS have sync issue with block 63312 - as we found that this early network block contains a transaction
with a mixin count of one hundred and one (101)..certainly private ;)   Even still, the CLI version is able to sync beyond it without any problem. GUI embedded node
however, will not..as we are finding out. If this rare scenario is upon you- or for any other reason- wish to use a blockchain download...
